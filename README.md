## Project Overview
---

Despite Nigeria producing thousands of university graduates annually, youth unemployment continues to pose a major challenge. This project explores the misalignment between the academic qualifications of Nigerian graduates and the evolving demands of the labor market between 2010 to 2024. By combining real data on graduate output by course with national unemployment statistics, the analysis offers a visual and factual narrative of why many young Nigerians remain unemployed not for lack of education, but because of a growing skills mismatch. This project uses interactive visualizations and trend analysis to present insights, identify gaps, and recommend evidence-based solutions for education and employment policy reforms.

## Data Sources
The data for this project was sourced from credible, publicly available platforms
- Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS)-Youth unemployment data (2010–2024)

- National Universities Commission (NUC)-Graduate output by discipline

- Labour Market Reports-Sector demand and trends

- World Bank & ILO Data-Macroeconomic and unemployment context

## Data Tools

- Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning and preparation
  
- Power BI – Data modeling and dashboard creation

- PowerPoint – Visual storytelling and presentation design

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Renamed and standardized column headers

- Cleaned missing data and removed inconsistencies in year and course names

- Aggregated yearly graduate output into six key disciplines:Engineering, ICT, Medical Sciences, Education, Agriculture, and Social Sciences

- Merged graduate data with national unemployment rates per year

- Ensured consistency between values and years for accurate year-over-year comparison

## Explanatory Data Analysis
To understand underlying patterns and trends, the following questions guided the exploratory phase

- How has Nigeria’s youth unemployment rate changed from 2010 to 2024?[Answer1](#answer1)

- Which courses produce the highest number of graduates annually?[Answer2](#answer2)

- Are sectors with high graduate supply aligned with employment opportunities?[Answer3](#answer3)

- Did external events like the COVID-19 pandemic affect interest in certain disciplines?[Answer4](#answer4)

- What impact did the NBS methodology change in 2023 have on reported unemployment rates?[Answer5](#answer5)

## Data Analysis

- Used Power BI to create visual breakdowns of graduate output by year and course

- Designed a timeline chart comparing unemployment trends with course supply

- Highlighted dominant fields (e.g., Education, Social Sciences) and underrepresented ones (e.g., Agriculture, ICT)

- Examined the 2023 NBS unemployment calculation change and adjusted trend interpretation accordingly

- Linked macroeconomic realities to shifts in graduate interest (e.g., 2020 spike in Medical Sciences)

## Key Findings
##### Answer1
Youth unemployment peaked in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and economic slowdown.Unemployment rate drop after 2023 is methodological not reflective of true improvement the calculation now counts more employed individuals in informal or short-time work due to the new NBS method of counting unemplyed inividuals

##### Answer2
Social Sciences and Education account for the majority of graduate output fields with limited direct employment pathways

##### Answer3
Sectors with high graduate supply are not alinged with employment opportunities. The mismatch has widened over time, with more graduates chasing fewer formal job openings
The largest oversupplies of graduates are in Education and Social Sciences, while ICT and Agriculture face clear shortages

##### Answer4
Sudden spike in 2020 caused by COVID-19 which brought about urgent need for healthcare workers, testing labs, and public health support.
which led to a visible surge in demand for  Medical Sciences graduates in 2020.

##### Answer5
In 2023 the National Bureau of Statistics introduced a new unemployment methodology. Now anyone working at least 1 hour per week including informal, gig or low paid work is considered employed. Unlike before where by you were considered employed only if you work at least 20 hours per week.This trickish decline doesn’t mean more quality jobs were created. It just means people are doing something no matter how small but many graduates are still underemployed, working outside their field or unemployed

## Recommendation

- Align Education with Market Needs: There is need to update university curricula to focus on ICT, digital skills, and emerging industries.

- Industry–University Collaboration: Build partnerships for internships, live projects, and job readiness programs.

- Youth Entrepreneurship & Startups: Support youth in self-employment and innovation, especially in ICT and agribusiness.

- Government & Private Sector Initiatives: Expand youth employability programs, apprenticeships, and skill grants.

## Outcome & Value
This project highlights the power of data storytelling in national policy issues. It brings together educational output, unemployment trends, and system-level challenges in one cohesive dashboard. The goal is to inform conversations around curriculum reform, youth empowerment, and better planning by education and labour institutions.
